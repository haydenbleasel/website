## Adventures

I love to explore new places and capture the beauty of nature and urban landscapes. I currently have a DJI Mavic 3 Pro which sports a Hasselblad triple-camera system capable of recording 4K video at 60FPS. I publish my individual clips on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hayden.bleasel/) and my full-length videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw95VUVc_2gh5oGx-jj9PnatiMKtQBiV2).

Here's my latest full-length video from Minnesota and South Dakota — an expedition through the frozen plains of the Midwestern United States.
