      I&apos;m the CPO at <Link href="/work/corellium">Corellium</Link> â€” a
      virtual hardware platform for government agencies and large enterprises to
      perform security research, penetration testing and development on mobile

      teams.

      Previously I ran an agency called{' '}
      <Link href="/work/jellypepper">Jellypepper</Link>. We worked with startups
      in self-driving car tech, AI, biotech, crypto, drone delivery,
