title: Making react-syntax-highlighter "editable"
description: react-syntax-highlighter is a great tool for highlighting code snippets, but it is not editable. Let's hack an editable state together!

The React library [react-syntax-highlighter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-syntax-highlighter) package is a handy little utility for highlighting code snippets. It supports a wide variety of languages and has a bunch of different themes. While it's very easy to use, it has one major drawback: it's not editable (fair enough since it's a syntax highlighter and not an editor).

I ran into this problem while building a [Refraction](/blog/refraction). While I switched to the obvious solution later (using [React-Ace](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-ace)), I thought my hack solution was interesting enough to share.

First up, let's render `react-syntax-highlighter` with some static JS code:

```tsx
const [code] = useState(`
 const fib = (n) => {
   if (n <= 1) {
     return n;
   }
   return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
 };
`);

return (
  <SyntaxHighlighter
    language="javascript"
    style={atomOneDark}
    customStyle={{
      flex: '1',
      background: 'transparent',
    }}
  >
    {code}
  </SyntaxHighlighter>
);
```

Now, let's add a `textarea` that is hidden behind the `react-syntax-highlighter` component. We'll use the `textarea` to capture the user's input.

```tsx
const [code, setCode] = useState(`
 const fib = (n) => {
   if (n <= 1) {
     return n;
   }
   return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
 };
`);

return (
  <div className="relative flex bg-[#282a36]">
    <textarea
      className="absolute inset-0 resize-none bg-transparent p-2 font-mono text-transparent caret-white outline-none"
      value={code}
      onChange={(e) => setCode(e.target.value)}
    />
    <SyntaxHighlighter
      language="javascript"
      style={atomOneDark}
      customStyle={{
        flex: '1',
        background: 'transparent',
      }}
    >
      {code}
    </SyntaxHighlighter>
  </div>
);
```

Last, we want to focus the `textarea` when the user clicks or presses a key on (what looks like) the `react-syntax-highlighter` component. We can do this by using a `ref` on the `textarea` and calling `focus()` on it.

Most importantly, we need to make sure the styles of the `textarea` are roughly the same as the `react-syntax-highlighter` component. Otherwise, the text selection on the `textarea` won't look right.

```tsx
const textareaRef = useRef<HTMLTextAreaElement>(null);
const [code, setCode] = useState(`
 const fib = (n) => {
   if (n <= 1) {
     return n;
   }
   return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
 };
`);

return (
  <div
    role="button"
    tabIndex={0}
    onKeyDown={() => textareaRef.current?.focus()}
    onClick={() => textareaRef.current?.focus()}
    className="relative flex bg-[#282a36]"
  >
    <textarea
      className="absolute inset-0 resize-none bg-transparent p-2 font-mono text-transparent caret-white outline-none"
      ref={textareaRef}
      value={code}
      onChange={(e) => setCode(e.target.value)}
    />
    <SyntaxHighlighter
      language="javascript"
      style={atomOneDark}
      customStyle={{
        flex: '1',
        background: 'transparent',
      }}
    >
      {code}
    </SyntaxHighlighter>
  </div>
);
```

Two interesting things to note:

1. `text-transparent` is a TailwindCSS class that makes the text transparent. This is important because we want the `textarea` to be invisible, but we still want the characters to be selectable.
2. `caret-white` is a TailwindCSS class that makes the caret white. This is important because the `textarea` is transparent, so the caret would be invisible. We want the caret to be visible so the user knows where they are typing.

And that's it! Now you can "edit" the code snippet in the `react-syntax-highlighter` component.
