Hi, I’m Hayden Bleasel.

I design and build software on the internet. I’m originally from Sydney, Australia and currently living in San Francisco, California 🇺🇸.

I work on the DX team at [Vercel](https://vercel.com), where I focus on the developer and end-user AI experience through building open source libraries and tools, such as [Streamdown](https://streamdown.ai), [AI Elements](https://ai-sdk.dev/elements) and [Remend](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remend).

After hours, I run [Haste](https://haste.ventures/) where I create high-quality software for the internet such as [Ultracite](https://ultracite.ai/) — a highly opinionated, zero-configuration linter and formatter. It's used by Vercel, Adobe, Clerk, Profound, Axiom, Tencent and even some government institutions.

## Work

Previously, I was the Chief Product Officer at Corellium. I moved to Delray Beach, Florida in 2021 to lead the Product, Design and Support teams. Corellium was [acquired](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/phone-unlocking-firm-cellebrite-to-acquire-mobile-testing-startup-corellium-for-170m/) by Cellebrite in 2025.

Before that, I was Director of Jellypepper, an award-winning digital agency for disruptive startups. We worked with early stage tech companies in niche areas such as self-driving car tech, AI, biotech, crypto, drone delivery, cybersecurity and even orbital (outer space) logistics. Jellypepper was [acquired](https://raw.studio/blog/raw-studio-acquires-jellypepper-to-expand-its-reach-to-the-startup-ecosystem/) by Raw Studio in 2024.

Earlier in my career, I was Head of Product and Design at Spaceship (later [acquired](https://www.afr.com/technology/cannon-brookes-backed-spaceship-acquired-in-80m-deal-20240926-p5kdo9) by eToro); contracted for many clients through [R/GA](https://campaignbrief.com/timberland-launches-new-timbstrails-immersive-digital-), interned at Palantir as a product designer in Palo Alto, California and a handful of other roles you can read about on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haydenbleasel/).

I've been fortunate to work with many great companies such as Australian Ethical, Canva, Clipchamp, Google, National Geographic, Nike, R/GA, Timberland, Toyota, Westfield and many more. I also [rebranded ESLint](https://eslint.org/blog/2022/08/redesigning-eslint/) and redesigned the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/diving-into-the-nodejs-website-redesign).
