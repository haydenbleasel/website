Baraja is a 3D machine vision systems manufacturer based in Australia, pioneering a new type of LiDAR (Light Detection and Range) called Spectrum-Scan™, a technology for self-driving cars. It opens up a whole new way to perceive the world, offering unmatched performance and control, helping you create AI perception that is superhuman.

Nick from Baraja reached out to us with the idea of designing a self-driving car startup that really stands out from the crowd. After being in stealth mode for two years and having raised from Blackbird and Sequoia, it was time for the company to step into the limelight.

## Just Sine Here

The Baraja brand is centred around their use of pointclouds — a set of data points in space produced by 3D scanners to visualise for humans what the scanner sees. They produce these using LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensorheads, mounted inside or on the roof of a vehicle, which send laser pulses out. Once the laser returns back to the sensor, the LiDAR system will record data based on information received.

Baraja is a Spanish word that, as a noun, means “a deck of cards”. As a verb, it means “to shuffle”. Baraja's LiDAR technology works by shooting beams of light into the environment, creating a visualisation of the world around the vehicle. The light can be steered by changing it's colour… “shuffling” the colour spectrum so to speak.

The new Baraja logo was inspired by a 3D Sine Wave sculpture out the front of the CSIRO facility, combined with the physics behind the spectrum (wavelength-based) scanning technology. We created a 3D model of a sine wave and captured a cross-section from a particular perspective, where it looked auspiciously like a Capital “B”… for Baraja.

The Baraja colour palette was inspired by pointclouds - a set of data points in space produced by 3D scanners to visualise for humans what the scanner sees. The primary purple was used as a throwback to the original logo with a touch of regal tone. Pointclouds are best viewed on a black background, so we gave the brand a dark theme with rich and eerie blacks that appear to make the palette glow.

We selected Averta as the singular typeface for the new brand - a geometric sans-serif family with a simplistic, yet appealing personality. Having a singular typeface made it easy for the manufacturing and engineering startup to quickly and easily release beautifully branded content.

## Laser focused

Baraja's primary product are LiDAR engines and sensorheads, mounted inside or on the roof of a vehicle. They send our laser pulses which bounce off the environment and return to the sensor, which the LiDAR system can then record into a pointcloud.

## LiDAR 101

When it comes down to it, LiDAR is actually pretty simple. Okay maybe not that simple, but we did make a series of short videos that explain how it all works.

### The Basics

Baraja's LiDAR connects a wavelength-tunable laser to prism-like optics and deflects light based on wavelengths and angles, a bit like Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon".

### Interference

Baraja's sensorheads are immune to interference from the sun or other LiDAR systems due to 3 key layers: the wavelength, horizontal and vertical angles at any given point in time.

### Software-defined

Baraja's sensorheads can also be configured with software, specifying which particular wavelength to scan enabling complete control over point density and resolution.

## Hello, World

The new Baraja website is sleek and straight to the point. LiDAR technology can be rather tricky to explain, so a few sections rely heavily on videos and interaction to draw you in and create a feeling of immersion. The website fits neatly on any device so you can learn about their products, watch the videos or even play with the product configurator!
