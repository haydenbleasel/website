Hi, I’m Hayden Bleasel.

I design and build software on the internet. I’m originally from Sydney, Australia and currently living in San Francisco, California 🇺🇸.

I work on the DX team at [Vercel](https://vercel.com), where I focus on the developer and end-user AI experience through building open source libraries and tools, such as [Streamdown](https://streamdown.ai), [AI Elements](https://ai-sdk.dev/elements) and [Remedy](#).

I'm also building [Ultracite](https://ultracite.ai/), a highly opinionated, zero-configuration linter and formatter based on Biome. It's used by Vercel, Adobe, Clerk, Profound, Axiom, Tencent and even some government institutions.

## Work

Previously, I was the Chief Product Officer at Corellium. I moved to Delray Beach, Florida in 2021 to lead the Product, Design and Support teams. Corellium was [acquired](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/phone-unlocking-firm-cellebrite-to-acquire-mobile-testing-startup-corellium-for-170m/) by Cellebrite in 2025.

Before that, I was Director of Jellypepper, an award-winning digital agency for disruptive startups. We worked with early stage tech companies in niche areas such as self-driving car tech, AI, biotech, crypto, drone delivery, cybersecurity and even orbital (outer space) logistics. Jellypepper was [acquired](https://raw.studio/blog/raw-studio-acquires-jellypepper-to-expand-its-reach-to-the-startup-ecosystem/) by Raw Studio in 2024.

Earlier in my career, I was Head of Product and Design at Spaceship (later [acquired](https://www.afr.com/technology/cannon-brookes-backed-spaceship-acquired-in-80m-deal-20240926-p5kdo9) by eToro); contracted for many clients through [R/GA](https://campaignbrief.com/timberland-launches-new-timbstrails-immersive-digital-), interned at Palantir as a product designer in Palo Alto, California and a handful of other roles you can read about on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haydenbleasel/).

I've been fortunate to work with many great companies such as Australian Ethical, Canva, Clipchamp, Google, National Geographic, Nike, R/GA, Timberland, Toyota, Westfield and many more. I also [rebranded ESLint](https://eslint.org/blog/2022/08/redesigning-eslint/) and redesigned the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/diving-into-the-nodejs-website-redesign). 

## Projects

I built a production-grade, best-in-class monorepo template for Next.js apps called [next-forge](https://www.next-forge.com/) and grew it to over 6,000 stars on GitHub. Vercel [acquired](https://x.com/haydenbleasel/status/1929625673586598148) it in 2025 as part of my hiring.

I made Orate — an AI toolkit for transcribing and synthesizing speech. After growing it to 400 stars on GitHub, Orate's functionality was [merged](https://x.com/haydenbleasel/status/1931033287851675688) into the Vercel AI SDK.

I made Kibo UI, a custom shadcn/ui component registry. I donated the AI components to Vercel to form the foundation of my first project — [AI Elements](https://ai-sdk.dev/elements). The remaining site was [acquired](https://www.shadcnblocks.com/blog/announcing-kibo-ui-acquisition/) by shadcnblocks.

One of my earlier successes was an app for AI code generation and refactoring called Refraction, which was [acquired](https://x.com/haydenbleasel/status/1678770475647012864) by Twistag.

I also maintain some open source apps, such as [Tersa](https://www.tersa.ai/) (an open source alternative to Flora) and [Eververse](https://www.eververse.ai/) (an open source alternative to Productboard). You can find the code for these on my [GitHub](https://github.com/haydenbleasel).
