Spaceship started in mid-2016 as a technology-focused superannuation fund (if you're not from Down Under, superannuation is a bit like a 401k pension plan). The idea was a new type of super fund focused on tech companies where you can get exposure in companies such as Apple, Google and Facebook - “invest where the world is going, not where it's been”.

I joined Spaceship in September 2016. We raised $1.6M from Atlassian's Mike Cannon-Brookes and ShowPo's Jane Lu, then in June the next year raised $19.5M from NEA, Sequoia Capital and Valar Ventures.

During my time at Spaceship, I worked with some insanely talented people to grow a waitlist of 28,000 people, design and build the marketing website and superannuation portal. I also created the foundations of the Spaceship design system that ran our multiple platforms and contributed towards the overall brand styleguide. We got featured in the **[Australian Financial Review](https://www.afr.com/technology/inside-the-multibillion-dollar-battle-for-millennials-super-20170606-gwl91y)** and I got quoted on the **[GRCI website](https://www.thegrcinstitute.org/news/view/2402)**.

Spaceship was a challenge and a rare opportunity to change the way millennials engaged with their finances. I loved the work we did at Spaceship and I hope they find the persistence to break through the regulatory restraints and truly disrupt the superannuation industry.
