I'm an Australian Design Engineer living in ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ San Francisco, California. I love creating beautiful software that delights users and reimagines the way we interact with technology. I'm also an avid drone pilot, gamer and open source maintainer.

I'm currently on the Developer Experience team at [Vercel](https://vercel.com) where I focus on building our community, sharing knowledge and helping developers build better products. After hours, I'm exploring new ideas (particularly AI-native apps) and building open source software. If you like my OSS work, you can [sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/haydenbleasel).

I maintain a small mailing list where I share infrequent updates on my projects and what's new. Join 2000+ readers if you're interested!

You can also read my [blog](/blog), [get in touch](/contact) or follow me on these platforms.

## Adventures

I love to explore new places and capture the beauty of nature and urban landscapes. I currently have a DJI Mavic 3 Pro which sports a Hasselblad triple-camera system capable of recording 4K video at 60FPS. I publish my individual clips on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hayden.bleasel/) and my full-length videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw95VUVc_2gh5oGx-jj9PnatiMKtQBiV2).

Here's my latest full-length video from Minnesota and South Dakota â€” an expedition through the frozen plains of the Midwestern United States.
