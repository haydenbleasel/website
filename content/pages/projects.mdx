I've built a lot of projects, apps and tools over the years. Many have failed and some have succeeded, but I've learned a lot from each of them.

One of my earlier successes was a tool for learning, improving and generating code with AI called [Refraction](https://www.refraction.com/) which was [acquired](https://x.com/haydenbleasel/status/1678770475647012864) by Twistag in 2023. Refraction was used by the world's most innovative companies, including Amazon, Accenture, Bentley, Cisco, IKEA, Repl.it, Roblox, Softbank, Sega, TikTok, Uber, Yahoo and more[^1].

I later built [next-forge](https://www.next-forge.com/) â€” a production-grade Turborepo template for Next.js apps. I released it for free in a market full of paid boilerplates and grew it to nearly 6,000 stars on GitHub, fostering a community of contributors and partners around it. It got some great coverge after Guillermo Rauch [posted it](https://x.com/rauchg/status/1853171412766466119), including a [YouTube review](https://youtu.be/aHZz_6NhQkQ) by Josh tried coding. Vercel [acquired](https://x.com/haydenbleasel/status/1929625673586598148) next-forge in 2025 as part of my hiring.

My most recent successful project is Orate &mdash; the AI toolkit for speech. It's a library for synthesizing speech, transcribing audio, converting voices and isolating audio. After growing it to around 400 stars on GitHub, Orate was merged into the Vercel AI SDK in 2025 as [`transcribe()`](https://x.com/aisdk/status/1909603418639155460) and [`generateSpeech()`](https://x.com/aisdk/status/1911763995272626504) functions.

Many of my projects are still active or in progress, including:
