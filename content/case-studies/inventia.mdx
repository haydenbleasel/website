Inventia is an Australian life sciences company dedicated to the development, manufacture and sale of equipment and reagents for advanced medical research assays by means of 3D bioprinting. Their low cost and standardised bio-based additive fabrication of 3D human tissue and organ models aim to transform the medical research sector by enabling the flexible production of 3D cell based assays.

Cameron from Inventia reached out to Jellypepper for help designing and building their new website and producing some marketing collateral. The new site was to focus on a balance of beauty and function, much like their award-winning Rastrum printer.

## Designed to Cell

We created a simple logo animation inspired by their printer mechanism to use as an intro and outro on marketing collateral.

The Inventia colour palette uses a vivid contrast of dark and light colours mixed with Rastrum pink, a colour derived from the printer and inspired by photography of cell cultures. It's designed to bring cell cultures and spheroid imagery to life, while evoking a sense of simplicity and beauty.

We paired it with the typeface Faktum - the interplay between clean lines and organic curves reflecting Inventia's minimalist aesthetic combined with the motif of a cell structure.

## The Future is 3D

The new Inventia website is beautiful, responsive and fast. It's built on Gatsby and Prismic which gives it unparalleled load times, and hosted on Netlify with automatic continuous integration and deployment.

Inventia relies on a balance of photography, video, 3D renders and iconography to convey complex ideas in cell biology. We created a set of custom icons for the new website to visualise the benefits of 3D cell cultures, features of RASTRUM hydrogels and more.

## Back to the lab

We also assisted in organising a photoshoot for the new Inventia site. We teamed up with a freelance photographer and videographer to capture a series of photos that showcases the Inventia team and their product. We also captured some footage to produce a looping background hero video for the homepage. In a few simple scenes, it conveys the entire RASTRUM experience from designing structures to printing models and performing downstream analysis.
