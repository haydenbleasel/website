I'm an Australian Design Engineer living in ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ San Francisco, California. I love creating beautiful software that delights users and reimagines the way we interact with technology. I'm also an avid drone pilot, gamer and open source maintainer.

I'm currently on the Developer Experience team at Vercel where I focus on building our community, sharing knowledge and helping developers build better products. After hours, I'm exploring new ideas (particularly AI-native apps) and building open source software. If you like my OSS work, you can [sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/haydenbleasel).

I maintain a small mailing list where I share infrequent updates on my projects and what's new. Join 2000+ readers if you're interested!

<MailingList />

I'm most active on [X](https://x.com/haydenbleasel) and [GitHub](https://github.com/haydenbleasel) if you want to chat or see what I'm up to.
