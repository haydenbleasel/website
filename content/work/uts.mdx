I was hired by my university to work on a new project for the Innovation & Creative Intelligence Unit. It is a web-based platform that allows motivated, entrepreneurial students to find other talented students, form groups and start working together on startups or ideas. The platform is called Skill Exchange and currently runs internally at UTS.
