I worked at MindArc as an automation engineer and Magento developer for a short while. I was primarily tasked with rebuilding Magento themes from ground up and creating helpful scripts, however I also worked on some of the client sites. Some of these include famous e-commerce sites like Hello Molly and ShowPo. I also redesigned the MindArc homepage from the ground up.
