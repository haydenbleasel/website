title: Neat User and Profile React Hooks for Firebase V9

For a good while, I've been relying on a little package called [react-firebase-hooks](https://github.com/CSFrequency/react-firebase-hooks) to turn my Firebase realtime document fetching into tidy hooks. However, this library has become a bit sketchy since the release of Firebase v9 a.k.a the Modular edition.

So, I decided to remove the dependency and write my own little hooks for the two most common types of Firebase objects I use - Users and Profiles (a collection in Firestore).

## The `useUser` Hook

The User hook is pretty straightforward. Firebase already gives us access to a handy function called `onAuthStateChanged` - an observer for changes to the user's "signed-in" state. It will either return a User object or `null`, which is perfect for passing straight into a `setUser` function.

The `updateUser` function is a bit trickier. I wanted to have a single function that I could pass a `displayName`, `email`, `password` or whatever other properties we could store on a User object. Firebase actually has different update functions for each of these. In the new V9, they're aptly named `updateEmail`, `updatePassword` and then `updateProfile` for everything else (name, photo, etc.)

Combining all this, we get the following hook!

```ts
import {
  getAuth,
  onAuthStateChanged,
  signOut,
  updateProfile,
  updateEmail,
  updatePassword,
} from 'firebase/auth';
import { useState } from 'react';
import type { User } from 'firebase/auth';

type UpdateUserProps = {
  displayName?: User['displayName'];
  photoURL?: User['photoURL'];
  email?: User['email'];
  password?: string | null;
};

const useUser = (): {
  user?: User | null;
  updateUser: (props: UpdateUserProps) => Promise<void>;
  logout: () => Promise<void>;
} => {
  const auth = getAuth();
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(auth.currentUser);

  onAuthStateChanged(auth, setUser);

  const updateUser = async ({
    displayName,
    photoURL,
    email,
    password,
  }: UpdateUserProps) => {
    if (!user) {
      return;
    }

    if (displayName) {
      await updateProfile(user, { displayName });
    }
    if (photoURL) {
      await updateProfile(user, { photoURL });
    }
    if (email) {
      await updateEmail(user, email);
    }
    if (password) {
      await updatePassword(user, password);
    }
  };

  const logout = async () => {
    await signOut(auth);
  };

  return { user, updateUser, logout };
};

export default useUser;
```

## The `useProfile` Hook

Since Firebase Users can only store high-level account and authentication info such as an email, phone number and photo, it's common practice to create a `Profile` collection in Firestore that contains any other info you want to store in relation to a particular user. It's also common practice to use the format `users/${user.uid}` for the collection path, so we'll make sure to accept a User object as a prop.

Anyway, let's talk about fetching data from Firestore. The new V9 has a handy function called `onSnapshot` that attaches a listener for `DocumentSnapshot` events, which is a fancy way of saying it subscribes to a collection and listens for updates. That function takes a document reference (or query), a "next" callback (for success) and an "error" callback. It also takes an "onComplete" callback but since the snapshot stream never ends, it's never called, so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

The easiest way to manage all this is to stuff it inside a `useEffect` function, remembering to cleanup your snapshot at the end (it returns an unsubscribe function üëç). For the dependency array, we want to pass the User's UID so it re-runs every time the user changes (which is handy for clearing the profile data when the user logs out).

Chuck in a loading states, some basic error handling and we've got ourselves a pretty neat profile hook!

```ts
import type { User } from 'firebase/auth';
import { getApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { doc, updateDoc, getFirestore, onSnapshot } from 'firebase/firestore';
import type { FirestoreError } from 'firebase/firestore';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

// Whatever your profile looks like!
export type ProfileProps = {};

type UseProfileResponse = {
  profile: ProfileProps | null | undefined;
  updateProfile: (newData: Partial<ProfileProps>) => Promise<void>;
  profileLoading: boolean;
  profileError: FirestoreError | undefined;
};

const useProfile = (
  user: Partial<User> | null | undefined
): UseProfileResponse => {
  const app = getApp();
  const firestore = getFirestore(app);
  const [profile, setProfile] = useState<ProfileProps | null>(null);
  const [profileError, setProfileError] = useState<
    FirestoreError | undefined
  >();
  const [profileLoading, setProfileLoading] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!user?.uid) {
      setProfile(null);
      return undefined;
    }

    setProfileLoading(true);
    const profileRef = doc(firestore, 'users', user.uid);
    const unsubscribe = onSnapshot(
      profileRef,
      (profileDoc) => {
        setProfile(profileDoc.data() as ProfileProps);
        setProfileLoading(false);
      },
      setProfileError
    );

    return unsubscribe;
  }, [firestore, user?.uid]);

  const updateProfile = async (
    newData: Partial<ProfileProps>
  ): Promise<void> => {
    if (!user?.uid) {
      return;
    }

    const profileRef = doc(firestore, 'users', user.uid);
    await updateDoc(profileRef, newData);
  };

  return {
    profile,
    updateProfile,
    profileLoading,
    profileError,
  };
};

export default useProfile;
```

Anyway, that's it for today. Happy hooking (and also Christmas üéÑüéÖ).
