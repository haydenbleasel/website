Hello! I'm Hayden Bleasel.

I'm an Australian designer, engineer and founder, currently based in ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ San Francisco, California. I work on the Developer Experience team at [Vercel](https://vercel.com), where I focus on creating tools, libraries and resources to help developers build better products.

After hours, I'm exploring new ideas (particularly AI-native apps) and building open source software. If you like my OSS work, you can [sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/haydenbleasel).

When I'm not coding, I love to travel and capture the beauty of nature and urban landscapes. I publish my individual clips on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hayden.bleasel/) and my full-length videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw95VUVc_2gh5oGx-jj9PnatiMKtQBiV2).

I maintain a small mailing list where I share infrequent updates on my projects and what's new. Join 2000+ readers if you're interested!
