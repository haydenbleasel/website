I've built a lot of projects, apps and tools over the years. Many have failed and some have succeeded, but I've learned a lot from each of them.

One of my earlier successes was a tool for learning, improving and generating code with AI called [Refraction](https://www.refraction.com/) which was [acquired](https://x.com/haydenbleasel/status/1678770475647012864) by Twistag in 2023. Refraction was used by the world's most innovative companies, including Amazon, Accenture, Bentley, Cisco, IKEA, Repl.it, Roblox, Softbank, Sega, TikTok, Uber, Yahoo and more[^1].

I later built [next-forge](https://www.next-forge.com/) â€” a production-grade Turborepo template for Next.js apps. I released it for free in a market full of paid boilerplates and grew it to nearly 6,000 stars on GitHub, fostering a community of contributors and partners around it. It got some great coverge after Guillermo Rauch [posted it](https://x.com/rauchg/status/1853171412766466119), including a [YouTube review](https://youtu.be/aHZz_6NhQkQ) by Josh tried coding. Vercel [acquired](https://x.com/haydenbleasel/status/1929625673586598148) next-forge in 2025 as part of my hiring.

My most recent successful project is Orate &mdash; the AI toolkit for speech. It's a library for synthesizing speech, transcribing audio, converting voices and isolating audio. After growing it to around 400 stars on GitHub, Orate was merged into the Vercel [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/) in 2025 as [`transcribe()`](https://x.com/aisdk/status/1909603418639155460) and [`generateSpeech()`](https://x.com/aisdk/status/1911763995272626504) functions.

Some of my projects are still active or in progress, including:

- [Tersa](https://www.tersa.ai/) - An open source canvas for building AI workflows.
- [Ultracite](https://www.ultracite.dev/) - Robust linting config for TypeScript apps, built on Biome.
- [Kibo UI](https://www.kibo-ui.com/) - Composable, open-source shadcn/ui components for React.
- [Eververse](https://www.eververse.ai/) - The open source product management platform.
