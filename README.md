## Colophon

This website is something between a CV and a reflection of my identity — my personal design style. Refined simplicity is my way of achieving mental clarity, so I spent most of my time focused on creating a rich narrative without a word wasted.

I’ve redesigned and rebuilt this website maybe 30 times. Every time I do, I bring in influences from around the internet that add to my personal moodboard of sorts. In turn, everything I change and add makes me more comfortable with the style and in turn, helps me discover myself a little more.

## Design

The design for this iteration is inspired by the layout of [Siddharth Arun](https://sdrn.co/) with typography from [Paco Coursey](https://paco.me/) (specifically Söhne) mixed with GT Super. Some of the components are inspired by shadcn's [UI Kit](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

## Technology

It’s built from ground-up with my favourite technologies, starting with Next.js and Vercel for the construct, then Tailwind for utility classes for rapid development.

## Installation

Download the repository and install the dependencies with:

```sh
yarn install
```

Create an `.env.local` file with the following variables:

```sh
VERCEL_TOKEN=""
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=""
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

Then run the local development server with:

```sh
yarn dev
```
