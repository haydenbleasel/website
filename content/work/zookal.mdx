During the first few years of my university degree, I was the lead front-end developer at Zookal. I worked directly with the CTO on building the new Zookal homepage, focusing on modern design and strong responsive capability for an e-commerce site. I also had the chance to work on Zookalâ€™s content-sharing app before it became a big deal in Asia.
