While I was in university, I co-founded Gunmetal - an independent web design and development studio. During this time, we had the privilege of working with a range of clients from startups to clothing brands and even big corporate and entertainment companies. Some of our clients included Vimbra, Trekalo, Ryzer, Wild Animal Encounters and National Geographic Channel.
