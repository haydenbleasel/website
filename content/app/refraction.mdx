I'm super excited to announce that earlier today, [Refraction](https://www.refraction.dev/) was acquired by [Twistag](https://twistag.com/) — a Lisbon based design and software agency who focus on delivering amazing digital products.

Powered by OpenAI, Refraction is a suite of tools for developers to generate unit tests, documentation, refactor code and more in 60+ supported languages and frameworks.

Our vision is to embed ourselves in every touchpoint of the developer ecosystem, from the moment a developer starts a new project to the moment they deploy it to production — a helping hand that streamlines, automates and simplifies the overall developer experience.

In just 6 months, Refraction quickly became our most successful and fastest-growing product, with 13K users, 60K+ code generations and over 2.5M lines of code generated. It started to become used by the world's most innovative companies, including Accenture, AKQA, Amazon, Bentley, Capgemini, Experian, Google, John Deere, Nespresso, PandaDoc, Qantas, Red Bull, Sega, Uber and Zoho.

In our first month, we were fortunate enough to be featured by [@spacecoding](https://www.instagram.com/spacecoding/) which got more than 20K views and brough a massive amount of traffic to our website.

We did some initial outbound marketing (a feature in [Ben's Bites](https://www.bensbites.co/p/ai-goes-tokyo-drift), some ProductHunt ads and general Twittering) but eventually found the best way to grow was simply to talk with customers, listen to their feedback and build a product that they love.

So, over the next few months, we focused on building a great product and community. We launched a slew of new [features](https://www.refraction.dev/features), started a support center and added an in-app messenger, launched a [blog](https://www.refraction.dev/blog), integrated with the developer ecosystem through [extensions](https://www.refraction.dev/extensions), rolled out [new plans](https://www.refraction.dev/pricing) for teams and even launched a GitHub PR reviewer called [Autoreview](https://www.refraction.dev/autoreview).

We are excited for Refraction to join the [Twistag](https://twistag.com/) family and continue our mission to help developers building great software with less effort.
