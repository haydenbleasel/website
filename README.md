# Daylight

Daylight is the personal website of [Hayden Bleasel](https://haydenbleasel.com/). It's built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). It's also open source, so feel free to fork it and make it your own!

## Developing locally

First, run the development server with `yarn dev`. This will install the required dependencies and start the Next.js development server. Emails are sent with Comlink, the Beskar Labs internal mailing system.

## Todo

- Add "Back to top" button to contextual nav when scrolling down
- Add better content and rich media to work pages
