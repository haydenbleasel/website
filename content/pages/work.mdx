My previous role was Chief Product Officer at [Corellium](https://www.corellium.com/), pioneers of an incredible Arm virtualisation platform. I moved to Delray Beach, Florida in 2021 to lead the Product, Design and Support teams in blurring the line between real and virtual for government agencies and enterprises. Corellium was [acquired](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/phone-unlocking-firm-cellebrite-to-acquire-mobile-testing-startup-corellium-for-170m/) by Cellebrite in 2025.

Before that, I was Director of [Jellypepper](https://jellypepper.com/), an award-winning digital agency for disruptive startups. We worked with early stage tech companies in niche areas such as self-driving car tech, AI, biotech, crypto, drone delivery, cybersecurity and even orbital (outer space) logistics. Jellypepper was [acquired](https://raw.studio/blog/raw-studio-acquires-jellypepper-to-expand-its-reach-to-the-startup-ecosystem/) by Raw Studio in 2024.

Earlier in my career, I was the Head of Product and Design at [Spaceship](https://www.spaceship.com.au/) (a leading Australian investing platform later [acquired](https://www.spaceship.com.au/news/etoro-completes-acquisition-spaceship/) by eToro); contracted for [R/GA](https://www.rga.com/) and did a product design internship at [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/) in Palo Alto, California.

I've also had the pleasure of working with open source organizations. You may have seen some of my work out there â€” [ESLint](https://eslint.org/blog/2022/08/redesigning-eslint/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/diving-into-the-nodejs-website-redesign) and [SWC plugins](https://plugins.swc.rs/) for example.

I've also been fortunate enough to work on a contracting basis with Australian Ethical, Canva, Clipchamp, ESLint, Google, National Geographic, Nike, Node.js, R/GA, Timberland, Toyota, Westfield and many more brilliant companies[^1].
