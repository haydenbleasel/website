Hello! I'm Hayden Bleasel.

I'm an Australian designer, engineer and founder, currently based in ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ San Francisco, California.

I'm on the Developer Experience team at Vercel, where I focus on building our community, sharing knowledge and helping developers build better products.

After hours, I'm exploring new ideas (particularly AI-native apps) and building open source software. If you like my OSS work, you can [sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/haydenbleasel).

I maintain a small mailing list where I share infrequent updates on my projects and what's new. Join 2000+ readers if you're interested!

<MailingList />

I'm most active on [X](https://x.com/haydenbleasel) and [GitHub](https://github.com/haydenbleasel) if you want to chat or see what I'm up to.

I love to explore new places and capture the beauty of nature and urban landscapes. I currently have a DJI Mavic 3 Pro which sports a Hasselblad triple-camera system capable of recording 4K video at 60FPS. I publish my individual clips on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hayden.bleasel/) and my full-length videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw95VUVc_2gh5oGx-jj9PnatiMKtQBiV2).

Here's my latest full-length video, venturing into the frozen frontier of Alaska.
