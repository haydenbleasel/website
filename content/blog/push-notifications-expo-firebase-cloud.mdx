Today we're going to implement Push Notifications in an Expo app using Firebase Cloud Functions - how exciting! Despite how complex Expo's diagrams appear, it's actually remarkably simple to add Push Notifications to your app!

Let's get started.

## Dependencies

First we're going to need a few things:

- [expo-server-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expo-server-sdk) - we'll use this in our cloud functions to actually send the Push Notification
- [expo-notifications](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/) to register our users and app for push notifications
- [expo-device](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/device/) to make sure we're running this code on a physical device
- [expo-linking](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/linking/) to open Settings in case the user rejects our Push Notification requests

Okay, that should be it. Now for the code!

## Overview

To get Push Notifications up and running, we need to get 4 small pieces working:

### `generatePushNotificationsToken` function

First up, we need to allow our users to generate Push Notification tokens. For the remainder of this post, we'll refer to it as the `expoPushToken`. As Expo phrased it:

> If push notifications are mail, then the ExpoPushToken is the user's address.

Generating this token is simple enough, but we just need to make sure we're handling permissions and rejections correctly.

```ts
import { isDevice } from 'expo-device';
import { openSettings } from 'expo-linking';
import {
  getPermissionsAsync,
  requestPermissionsAsync,
  getExpoPushTokenAsync,
} from 'expo-notifications';
import { Alert } from 'react-native';

const generatePushNotificationsToken = async (): Promise<
  string | undefined
> => {
  if (!isDevice) {
    throw new Error(
      'Sorry, Push Notifications are only supported on physical devices.'
    );
  }

  const { status: existingStatus } = await getPermissionsAsync();

  let finalStatus = existingStatus;

  if (existingStatus !== 'granted') {
    const { status } = await requestPermissionsAsync();
    finalStatus = status;
  }

  if (finalStatus !== 'granted') {
    Alert.alert(
      'Error',
      'Sorry, we need your permission to enable Push Notifications. Please enable it in your privacy settings.',
      [
        {
          text: 'OK',
        },
        {
          text: 'Open Settings',
          onPress: async () => openSettings(),
        },
      ]
    );
    return undefined;
  }

  const { data } = await getExpoPushTokenAsync();

  return data;
};

export default generatePushNotificationsToken;
```

Now we can import this file into our Settings page (or wherever) and call it. You're going to want to store the `expoPushToken` on your user's profile. I'm using the [useUser and useProfile](/blog/user-profile-hooks-firebase-9) hooks I talked about previously.

```ts
import generatePushNotificationsToken from '../../utils/expo/generatePushNotificationsToken';

// ...

const { user } = useUser();
const { profile, updateProfile } = useProfile(user);
const [notificationsEnabled, setNotificationsEnabled] = useState<boolean>(
  typeof profile?.expoPushToken === 'string'
);

const toggleNotifications = async (newEnabled: boolean) => {
  setNotificationsEnabled(newEnabled);
  try {
    if (newEnabled && !profile?.expoPushToken) {
      const token = await generatePushNotificationsToken();
      if (!token) {
        setNotificationsEnabled(!newEnabled);
        return;
      }

      await updateProfile({ expoPushToken: token });
    } else if (!newEnabled && profile?.expoPushToken) {
      await updateProfile({ expoPushToken: null });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    setNotificationsEnabled(!newEnabled);
    catchError(error);
  }
};
```

### `usePushNotifications` hook

Now we need to register our app to receive Push Notifications. I've redesigned this piece as a hook so its self-contained, but it can probably just be another function if you wanted.

This hook takes a prop called `onTapNotification` which sends a standard `NotificationResponse` which lets you run custom functionality when a user taps a push notification. It also returns the current `notification` if you need.

```ts
import useAsync from 'react-use/lib/useAsync';
import { useRef, useState } from 'react';
import {
  addNotificationReceivedListener,
  addNotificationResponseReceivedListener,
  AndroidImportance,
  removeNotificationSubscription,
  setNotificationChannelAsync,
  setNotificationHandler,
} from 'expo-notifications';
import type { Subscription } from 'expo-modules-core';
import type { Notification, NotificationResponse } from 'expo-notifications';
import { Platform } from 'react-native';

setNotificationHandler({
  handleNotification: async () => ({
    shouldShowAlert: true,
    shouldPlaySound: false,
    shouldSetBadge: false,
  }),
});

const usePushNotifications = (
  onTapNotification?: (response: NotificationResponse) => void
): {
  notification: Notification | null;
} => {
  const [notification, setNotification] = useState<Notification | null>(null);
  const notificationListener = useRef<Subscription>();
  const responseListener = useRef<Subscription>();

  useAsync(async () => {
    notificationListener.current =
      addNotificationReceivedListener(setNotification);

    responseListener.current = addNotificationResponseReceivedListener(
      (response) => onTapNotification?.(response)
    );

    if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
      await setNotificationChannelAsync('default', {
        name: 'default',
        importance: AndroidImportance.MAX,
        vibrationPattern: [0, 250, 250, 250],
        lightColor: '#FF231F7C',
      });
    }

    return () => {
      if (notificationListener.current) {
        removeNotificationSubscription(notificationListener.current);
      }
      if (responseListener.current) {
        removeNotificationSubscription(responseListener.current);
      }
    };
  });

  return { notification };
};

export default usePushNotifications;
```

You can use it somewhere higher up, such as `App.tsx`, simply by adding `usePushNotifications()` to your component, or if you want to use all the features:

```ts
const { notification } = usePushNotifications((response) =>
  console.log(response)
);

console.log({ notification });
```

If you're keen to hit pause and give this a try, you can use Expo's [Push Notification Tool] with that `expoPushToken` you generated and see if your app receives it!

### `sendPushNotification` cloud function

Next up, we'll want to write a handy utility function for actually sending push notifications from our Firebase Cloud Functions. This example is designed for a single Push Notification to a single user, but if you're wanting to send a buttload of them at once, Expo have written an interesting [usage example](https://github.com/expo/expo-server-sdk-node#usage) with chunking.

Also, this has enhanced security for push notifications enabled (i.e. the Expo access token) so make sure you generate one in your dashboard.

```ts
import type { ExpoPushMessage } from 'expo-server-sdk';
import { Expo } from 'expo-server-sdk';

const expo = new Expo({ accessToken: process.env.EXPO_ACCESS_TOKEN });

type SendPushNotificationProps = {
  pushToken: string;
  message: string;
};

const sendPushNotification = async ({
  pushToken,
  message,
}: SendPushNotificationProps): Promise<void> => {
  const messages: ExpoPushMessage[] = [];

  if (!Expo.isExpoPushToken(pushToken)) {
    console.error(`Push token ${pushToken} is not a valid Expo push token`);
    return;
  }

  messages.push({
    to: pushToken,
    sound: 'default',
    body: message,
  });

  try {
    await expo.sendPushNotificationsAsync(messages);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};

export default sendPushNotification;
```

Nice one! Now we have a way of actually sending notifications to users. Now we just need to implement it.

### Sending the push notification

And now for the main event. Our Firebase user has their `expoPushToken` on their profile, so we just need to retrieve their profile, check their `expoPushToken` and send a Push Notification if it exists!

```ts
const webhook = functions.https.onRequest(async (req, res) => {
  const { uid } = req.body;
  const doc = await admin.firestore().collection('users').doc(uid).get();

  if (!doc.exists) {
    console.log(`No profile found for ${uid}.`);
    return;
  }

  console.log(`Found user profile for ${uid}...`);

  const data = doc.data();

  if (typeof data?.expoPushToken !== 'string') {
    console.log(`No push token found for ${uid}.`);
    return;
  }

  console.log(`Sending push notification to ${uid}...`);

  await sendPushNotification({
    pushToken: data.expoPushToken,
    message: 'Hello... is this thing working?',
  });
});
```

That's it! You've got a push notifications system up and running. Let me know in the comments if you had any problems or can think of some improvements!

Happy notifying 🔔
