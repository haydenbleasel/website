title: Projects
description: I've built a lot of projects, apps and tools over the years. Many have failed and some have succeeded, but I've learned a lot from each of them.

One of my earlier successes was a tool for learning, improving and generating code with AI called Refraction which was [acquired](https://x.com/haydenbleasel/status/1678770475647012864) by Twistag in 2023. Refraction was used by the world's most innovative companies, including Accenture, AKQA, Amazon, Bentley, Canva, CapGemini, Cisco, Experian, ExpressVPN, Google, H&M, Ikea, John Deere, Nespresso, PandaDoc, Qantas, Rakuten, Red Bull, Repl.it, Roblox, Softbank, Sega, Tiktok, Uber, Washington Post, Wix, Yahoo, Zoho and ZoomInfo and more.

I later built [next-forge](https://www.next-forge.com/) — a production-grade Turborepo template for Next.js apps. I released it for free in a market full of paid boilerplates and grew it to nearly 6,000 stars on GitHub, fostering a community of contributors and partners around it. It got some great coverage after Guillermo Rauch [posted it](https://x.com/rauchg/status/1853171412766466119). Vercel [acquired](https://x.com/haydenbleasel/status/1929625673586598148) next-forge in 2025 as part of my hiring.

I also made Orate &mdash; the AI toolkit for speech. It was a library for synthesizing speech, transcribing audio, converting voices and isolating audio. After growing it to around 400 stars on GitHub, Orate was merged into the Vercel [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/) in 2025 as [`transcribe()`](https://x.com/aisdk/status/1909603418639155460) and [`generateSpeech()`](https://x.com/aisdk/status/1911763995272626504) functions.

I'm currently working on [Ultracite](https://www.ultracite.ai/), the AI-ready formatter that helps you write and generate code faster. It's effectively a zero-config Biome preset that provides a robust linting and formatting experience for your team and your AI integrations.

I'm also working on [Kibo UI](https://www.kibo-ui.com/), a custom registry of composable, accessible and open source components designed for use with shadcn/ui.

I also made some open source alternatives to existing tools, including [Tersa](https://www.tersa.ai/), an open source alternative to Flora, and [Eververse](https://www.eververse.ai/), an open source alternative to Productboard.
