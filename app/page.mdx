Hi, I’m Hayden Bleasel.

I design and build software on the internet. I’m originally from Sydney, Australia and currently living in San Francisco, California.

I work on the DX team at [Vercel](https://vercel.com), where I focus on the developer and end-user AI experience. I invented new, open source libraries such as [Streamdown](https://streamdown.ai), [AI Elements](https://ai-sdk.dev/elements) and [Remedy](#). I also built registries like [Vercel Platforms](https://vercel.com/platforms), co-authored [components.build](https://www.components.build), rebuilt our docs and worked on templates like [Vectr](https://www.vectr.store) and [Workflow Builder](https://workflow-builder.dev/).

## Work

Previously, I was the Chief Product Officer at [Corellium](https://www.corellium.com). I moved to Delray Beach, Florida in 2021 to lead the Product, Design and Support teams. Corellium was [acquired](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/phone-unlocking-firm-cellebrite-to-acquire-mobile-testing-startup-corellium-for-170m/) by Cellebrite in 2025.

Before that, I was Director of Jellypepper, an award-winning digital agency for disruptive startups. We worked with early stage tech companies in niche areas such as self-driving car tech, AI, biotech, crypto, drone delivery, cybersecurity and even orbital (outer space) logistics. Jellypepper was [acquired](https://raw.studio/blog/raw-studio-acquires-jellypepper-to-expand-its-reach-to-the-startup-ecosystem/) by Raw Studio in 2024.

Earlier in my career, I was the Head of Product and Design at Spaceship (later [acquired](https://www.afr.com/technology/cannon-brookes-backed-spaceship-acquired-in-80m-deal-20240926-p5kdo9) by eToro); contracted for many clients through R/GA, interned at Palantir as a product designer in Palo Alto, California and a handful of other roles you can read about on my LinkedIn.

I've been fortunate to work with many great companies such as Australian Ethical, Canva, Clipchamp, Google, National Geographic, Nike, R/GA, Timberland, Toyota, Westfield and many more. I also [rebranded ESLint](https://eslint.org/blog/2022/08/redesigning-eslint/) and redesigned the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/diving-into-the-nodejs-website-redesign). 

## Projects

I built a production-grade, best-in-class monorepo template for Next.js apps called next-forge and grew it to over 6,000 stars on GitHub. Vercel acquired it in 2025 as part of my hiring.
I made Orate — an AI toolkit for transcribing and synthesizing speech. After growing it to 400 stars on GitHub, Orate was merged into the Vercel AI SDK in 2025 as transcribe() and generateSpeech().
I made Kibo UI, a custom shadcn/ui component registry. I donated the AI components to Vercel to form the foundation of my first project — AI Elements. The remaining site was acquired by shadcnblocks in 2025.
One of my earlier successes was a tool for learning, improving and generating code with AI called Refraction, which was acquired by Twistag in 2023.
I also maintain some open source apps, such as Tersa (an open source alternative to Flora) and Eververse (an open source alternative to Productboard). You can find the code for these on my GitHub.
