The power, the ability to create, to move, to inspire. Such is the **translation** of purpose to the written word. A blank slate, a canvas for my voice. Painting with phrases, an artist of language deriving meaning from symbols.

A dance of verse, a rhythm of words. Such logic and precision nested within it's patterns and flow. Rhythmic devices creating form and structure, intertwined into a rich tapestry of **expressions**.

A language of the heart, of the mind. The ability to build entire worlds at my fingertips. What ends may I divine?

> Poetry, physics, same thing... because of the rhymes. â€” Peter Capaldi
